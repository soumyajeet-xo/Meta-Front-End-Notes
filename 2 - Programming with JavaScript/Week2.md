# The Building Block Of A Program
Here you'll learn how to use objects, arrays and functions. In addition, you will learn about the most common built-in methods, and the difference between undefined, null and empty strings. And you'll explore both error handling and defensive programming. After completing this module, you will be able to:
Learning Objectives
Build and use objects, arrays, and functions
List some common built-in methods on built-in objects
Describe handling bugs and errors using try, catch, throw, and defensive programming
Explain the difference between undefined, null, and empty strings
Demonstrate how to write basic code using arrays, objects, and functions

# Arrays, Objects and Fucntions
### Video 1 : Functions
- function keyword for function declaration
- Advantage, declaration, use and call/invoke/run
- DRY acronym - Dont repeat yourself
- function parameter and arguments (unlike java )



### Video 2 : Storing data in arrays
- array
- var train1= ["wheat","barley","potato"];

### Video 3 : Introduction to objects
- object is basically specific state
- object has an identity, a behavior and a state. 
- object are used to relate different datas
- object declaration     d
  ```
  var a = {};
  a.first=1;
  a.second = "two";
  ```
- object are collection of related properties
- property key and property value
- ```
     var a = {
     first : 1,
     second : "two" } 
  ```
- dot notation

First-class functions

It means that a function in JavaScript is just another value that we can:
* pass to other functions
* save in a variable
* return from other functions

Higher-order functions
* It accepts other functions as arguments
* It returns functions when invoked

Pure function - function which will return the same value every time as long as the input are same.

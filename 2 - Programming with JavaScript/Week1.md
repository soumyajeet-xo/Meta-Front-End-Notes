# Setting up
### Video 1 : Introduction to Programming with JavaScript
- js can also be used for backend
- introduction to the course

### Video 2 : How is JavaScript used in the real world?
- js is used in everyday technology
- inconsistent / weird

### Video 3 : Setting up VS code (Optional)
- Vs code setup and first hello world program

# Welcome to Programming

### Video 4 : Introduction to programming
- intro to programming and programmning language (facilitate communication bw computer and user)
- binary code, electrical switches, ram
- high and low level language : The zeros and ones of binary code is a low-level language because it's closer to being understood by a CPU. JavaScript on the other hand is a high-level language. This means that it has to be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with it.
- computer program meaning 



### Video 5 : Why JavaScript?
- javascript for interactivity in webpages
- language of the web
- js alternative (vscript and typecript)
- browser have js engine build in
- node js and npm


### Video 6 : Programming in JavaScript
- many use cases of js
- jquery - javascript library that solves js compatibility issue in different browser
- react - solves issues that creating, maintaining and updating complex websites


Writing your first Javascript code (browser)

### Video 7 : Variables
- need structure to write js  code
- variable declaration, assign, use
- var keyword
- var application in console (var person = "John");
- console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");

Exercise: Declaring variables
https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/uuuxg/exercise-declaring-variables


### Video 8 : Data types
- primitive datatypes (7) String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, BigInt, Symbol
- data meaning


### Video 9 :  Operators
- Assignment,Comparison, logical operator, Arithematic operators
- they control the flow of program
- almost same as java
- = is used as assignment and == is used as comparison operator.



### Video 10 : Numbers
- A foundational datatype represents integer and decimal
- demonstration of Number data type and various operators in chrome console
- ** is used as power operator
- modulas % operator gives remainder
- operator precedence and brackets


### Video 11 : Strings
- sequence of characters represented in single or double quotes (delimiters)
- empty string '' ""
- works a little like python



### Video 12 : Booleans
- true/false
- > , < , ==
- strict  equality === (check for both value and type)
- == ingnores the type of the data type (weird :| )
- strict unequality !==
- operator associativity and operator precedence

Operators in depth : https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/xmXcT/operators-in-depth
+ plus can be used as concatenation
+ += for accumulation (same as java)
+ For example, the assignment operator is right-to-left associative, while the greater than operator is left-to-right associative:

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

# Conditionals and Loops

### Video 13 : Writing statements
- conditions
- conditional statement if, if-else, else if
- 



### Video 14 : Working with conditional statements
- switch statement (works like java)

Conditional examples : https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/oIsxQ/conditional-examples

### Video 16 : Looping constructs
- loop for repetitive tasks
- infinite loop
- loop same as java just var inplace of variable datatype
- for loop, while loop, nested loop
- declaration,condition,incrementaion
- for and while loop difference is start counter lies outside the body of the while loop


### Video 17 : For loop
- for loop implementation (almost same as java)
- preincrement and post increment (++i and i++)


### Video 18 : While loop
- counter value is declared outside the loop and condtion is in parenthesis (increment is typically in loop body)



### Video 19 : Nested loops
- two interdependent process
- they are resource expensive (same as java )(time complexity ofcourse) 

 Loops and nested loops : https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/KSxyh/loops-and-nested-loops
 
 ```
 //nested loops - one inside another 
for (var i = 100; i > 10; i = i - 10) {
    for (var j = 10; j > 4; j = j - 5) {
        console.log(i + " divided by " + j + " equals " + i / j);
    }
}
 ```
